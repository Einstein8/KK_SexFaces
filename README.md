# SexFaces plugin for Koikatsu
Adds the ability to set custom facial expressions to be displayed during H scenes (as opposed to the ones hardcoded into the game).

Originally forked from ManlyMarco's [KK_SkinEffects plugin](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KK_SkinEffects), but modified beyond recognition.

## Installation
1. Install [KKAPI](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/KKAPI) and its dependencies.
1. Download and build this project in Visual Studio.
1. Copy the contents of bin into your game directory.

## Usage
Sex faces can be added individually for each character, using the ❤ -> Sex Faces menu inside the Character Editor. You can set a sex face for each combination of sexual experience and context (foreplay, insertion, orgasm). You don't have to add a face for every combination, the rest will be handled by the game as usual.
